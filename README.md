# Matts Foundry Content
A collection of custom items and automation for DnD 5e games in Foundry: VTT.

These items are primarily homebrew, could be completely game-breaking, and probably don't make sense out of context of the game for which they were developed.  Bottom line, they are not meant for third-party use.  Feel free to use code, but there is no guarantee that it's maintained with compatibility in mind, and frankly, most of it is probably done poorly anyway; I'm not anywhere close to an expert in the Foundry API, Javascript, HTML, or CSS.

Licensed content will not be included here either; items with descriptions will typically be only the home-brew items (the focus here is automation).

# Dependencies
